# ZoomTools v 1.0
Tiny Sketch.app plugin does two things:

- Scroll to top of current artboard
- Zoom to 75% of current arboard

**This is a very simple fork of the plugin [ArtboardZoom](https://github.com/Arkkimaagi/ArtboardZoom) by Mikko Tapionlinna**

## How to Use
  Select `Plugins ‚ñ∏ ArtboardZoom ‚ñ∏ ArtboardZoom` in the Sketch menu bar or use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>4</kbd> to zoom to the Artboard of selected layer. This is helpful if you're designing small screens like mobile screens.

  If you prefer to zoom at 100% while centering the currently selected artboard, I've saved you one extra keypress by having an shortcut for it <kbd>‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>‚å•</kbd> + <kbd>4</kbd>

**Keyboard Shortcut**

| *Shortcut*                                 | *Action*                                       |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| <kbd>‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>‚å•</kbd> + <kbd>3</kbd> | Scroll to top of currently selected artboard   |
| <kbd>‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>‚å•</kbd> + <kbd>4</kbd> | Zoom to currently selected artboard at 75%     |
